# IR Remote Controlled Servo Motor

This project demonstrates how to control a servo motor using an IR remote and an Arduino. The project uses the `IRremote` library to decode the signals from the IR remote and the `Servo` library to control the servo motor.

## Introduction
This project allows you to control the position of a servo motor using an IR remote. When a specific button on the remote is pressed, the servo motor rotates to the desired position.

## Features
- Control a servo motor using an IR remote.
- Move the servo to 180 degrees or back to 0 degrees based on the remote command.

## Hardware Required
- Arduino Uno or any compatible board
- Servo motor
- IR receiver module
- IR remote
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard

## Software Required
- Arduino IDE
- `IRremote` library
- `Servo` library

## Circuit Diagram
Connect the components as follows:

- **IR Receiver**:
  - `VCC` to Arduino `5V`
  - `GND` to Arduino `GND`
  - `OUT` to Arduino `pin 8` (defined as `IR_RECEIVE_PIN`)

- **Servo Motor**:
  - `VCC` to Arduino `5V`
  - `GND` to Arduino `GND`
  - `Signal` to Arduino `pin 7` (defined as `Spin`)

## Installation
1. Install the Arduino IDE from the [official website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
2. Install the `IRremote` library:
   - Open Arduino IDE.
   - Go to `Sketch` > `Include Library` > `Manage Libraries`.
   - Search for `IRremote` and install it.
3. Install the `Servo` library:
   - Open Arduino IDE.
   - Go to `Sketch` > `Include Library` > `Manage Libraries`.
   - Search for `Servo` and install it.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the `ir_servo_control.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
3. Upload the code to your Arduino board.
4. Open the Serial Monitor from the Arduino IDE to see the received commands.
5. Point the IR remote at the IR receiver and press the buttons:
   - Press the button that sends the command `8` to move the servo from 0 to 180 degrees.
   - Press the button that sends the command `9` to move the servo back from 180 to 0 degrees.

The code for this project can be found in the [ir_servo_control.ino](./path/to/ir_servo_control.ino) file in this repository.

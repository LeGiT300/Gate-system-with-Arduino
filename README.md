# Gate-system-with-Arduino
This project mimics a remote controlled system. This one was built with arduino UNO 
The project was built using the iremote and servo library on arduino
The aim of the project was to turn a servo motor left or right with a remote control
Buttons on different remotes have different values so, you need to map each value to the specific button you want and then play with the logic the way you want.
